## WHAT IS HACKTOBER?
A month-long celebration from October 1st - 31st sponsored by Digital Ocean and GitHub to get people involved in Open Source. Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open source developer community and also get some cool swags!

## WHY OPENSOURCE?
Open-sourcing is a cost-effective way of contributing to projects. Opensource makes it possible to have fewer bugs and faster fixes. People are always looking for flaws to fix. Oh and also you get some cool swags for your contributions ðŸ‘€

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?

1. Fork the project, using the gray `Fork` button in the top right of this page
2. Make any changes in your forked repo
3. On this repo, click `Pull Requests` (which is the third option at the top of this page after the options `Code` and `Issues`) and raise a Pull Request by clicking the green `New Pull Request` button and selecting your fork from the right drop down field.

Questions can be asked by raising an `Issue`.

You can also join our whatsapp group and get any clarifications. The link is *Link here*
